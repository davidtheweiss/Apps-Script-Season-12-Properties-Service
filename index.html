      <p class='story' data-story='Submarine' style='display:none;'>CHAPTER I<br><br>A SHIFTING REEF<br><br>The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter.<br><br>For some time past vessels had been met by "an enormous thing," a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.<br><br>The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length—we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions</p>
      <p class='story' data-story='Pride' style='display:none;'>Chapter 1<br><br>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.<br><br>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.<br><br>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”<br><br>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.<br><br>“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.”<br><br>Mr. Bennet made no answer.<br><br>“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.<br><br>“You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”<br><br>This was invitation enough.<br><br>“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see</p>
      <p class='story' data-story='Frankenstein' style='display:none;'>Letter 1<br><br>To Mrs. Saville, England.<br><br>St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.<br><br>You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.<br><br>I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders</p>
      <p class='story' data-story='TomSawyer' style='display:none;'>CHAPTER I<br><br>“TOM!”<br><br>No answer.<br><br>“TOM!”<br><br>No answer.<br><br>“What’s gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!”<br><br>No answer.<br><br>The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear:<br><br>“Well, I lay if I get hold of you I’ll—”<br><br>She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.<br><br>“I never did see the beat of that boy!”<br><br>She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So she lifted up </p>
